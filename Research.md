# Data ``Validation``


### What is Data Validating
Imagine you run < your application > and you want visitors to sign up on the website with real names and not something like ``l337_p@nda`` in the first name field.

How would you define ``the limitations of what can be inputted and validate it against the validation rules set?``

### Validation procedure
>The data validation Procedure was designed to improve the quality of data by finding inconsistencies in the data.

For example:

The user's ``birth date`` **can't be** later than the ``date of the operation``.

### Validation rules

A Validation rule is a criterion or constraint used in the process of data validation, carried out after the data has been encoded onto an input medium and involves a data validation program.

In other words ``validation rules`` are the rules to ensure the internal data integrity.

#### Input
The first type of validation hapi can perform is input validation. This is defined in the **config** object on a route and is able to validate

``headers, path parameters, query parameters, and payload data.``

For example:

```js
validate: {
    payload: {
      email: Joi.string().email().required(),
      password: Joi.string().min(6).max(200).required()
      ```
Another example

```js
const Joi = require('joi');

const schema = Joi.object().keys({
  username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
  password: Joi.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}$/),
  access_token: [Joi.string(), Joi.number()],
  birthyear: Joi.number().integer().min(1900).max(2013),
  email: Joi.string().email()
}).with('username', 'birthyear').without('password', 'access_token');

// Return result.
const result = Joi.validate({ username: 'abc', birthyear: 1994 }, schema);
// result.error === null -> valid

// You can also pass a callback which will be called synchronously with the validation result.
Joi.validate({ username: 'abc', birthyear: 1994 }, schema, function (err, value) { });  // err === null -> valid
```
The above schema defines the following constraints:

  username
      a required string
      must contain only alphanumeric characters
      at least 3 characters long but no more than 30
      must be accompanied by birthyear

  password
      an optional string
      must satisfy the custom regex
      cannot appear together with access_token

  access_token
      an optional, unconstrained string or number

  birthyear
      an integer between 1900 and 2013

  email
      a valid email address string

# **Authentication**

![alt text](https://achievement-images.teamtreehouse.com/badges_Ruby_UserAuthentication_Stage1.png)


#### What are authentication and password encryption ?

#### Authentication :       

is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access .

#### Password encryption :

is the conversion of password into another form, called ciphertext, which cannot be easily understood by anyone except authorized parties.

#### How we can be implement both in hapi?

![alt text](https://hapijs.com/public/img/logo.svg)

Authentication within hapi is based on the concept of schemes and strategies.Think of a scheme as a general type of auth, like "basic" or "digest". A strategy on the other hand, is a pre-configured and named instance of a scheme.

#### First, let's take a look at an example of how to use hapi-auth-basic:


```js
'use strict';

const Bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const Hapi = require('hapi');
const Basic = require('hapi-auth-basic');

const server = new Hapi.Server();
server.connection({ port: 3000 });

const users = {
  john: {
      username: 'john',
      password: '$2a$10$iqJSHD.BGr0E2IxQwYgJmeP3NvhPrXAeLSaGCj6IR/XU5QtjVu5Tm',   // 'secret'
      name: 'John Doe',
      id: '2133d32a'
  }
};

const validate = function (request, username, password, callback) {
  const user = users[username];
  if (!user) {
      return callback(null, false);
  }

  Bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, (err, isValid) => {
      callback(err, isValid, { id: user.id, name: user.name });
  });
};

server.register(Basic, (err) => {

  if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

  server.auth.strategy('simple', 'basic', { validateFunc: validate });
  server.route({
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/',
      config: {
          auth: 'simple',
          handler: function (request, reply) {
              reply('hello, ' + request.auth.credentials.name);
          }
      }
  });

  server.start((err) => {

      if (err) {
          throw err;
      }

      console.log('server running at: ' + server.info.uri);
  });
});
```
----

#### First, we define our users database,

which is a simple object in this example.

#### Then we define a validation function,

which is a feature specific to hapi-auth-basic and allows us to verify that the user has provided valid credentials.

#### Next, we register the plugin,

which creates a scheme with the name of basic. This is done within the plugin via server.auth.scheme().

#### Once the plugin has been registered,

we use `server.auth.strategy()` to create a strategy with the name of ``simple`` that refers to our scheme named basic.

We also pass an options object that gets passed to the scheme and allows us to configure its behavior.

#### The last thing we do is

tell a route to use the strategy named simple for authentication.

# **Templating with Helper Functions**

![alt text]( https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAU3AAAAJDgxYjAwNDZmLTZjNzEtNDAzYi1hY2QzLWZjMDdiMzUwNDYzZA.jpg)

### A glance on why we use handlebars.js or any JS templating engines.

  * You use a JavaScript front-end framework; most front-end JavaScript frameworks rely on templating engines.

  * The application’s view (the HTML page or portions of the page) will be updated frequently, especially as a result of changes to the data either from the server via a REST API or from data on the client.

  * Your application has much interactivity and it is very responsive.

  * You are developing a single-page web application with multiple views.

  * You want to easily manage your HTML content; you don’t want your JavaScript code to contain important HTML markup.

### What are helper functions ?

Basically, functions used in templates to manipulate data.

### How they can be implemented in handlebars?

A Handlebars helper call is a simple identifier, followed by zero or more parameters (separated by space). Each parameter is a ```Handlebars expression```.

### What is Handlebars expression?

>Handlebars expressions are the basic unit of a Handlebars template. You can use them alone in a ** {{mustache}} **, pass them to a Handlebars helper or use them as values in hash arguments.

#### There are 2 kinds of helpers,

a function helper and a block helper.

The difference is that one is meant for a single expression and the other uses a block expression (a mechanism for invoking a helper with a block of the template).

** Custom Function Helpers **

To create one, we have to register it using the registerHelper() method. Inside your script, add this bit of code at the very top.

```js
//Create a custom function helper to check the status.
Handlebars.registerHelper( "checkStatus", function ( status ){
    if (status == "leaving" )
    {
        return 'leave';
    }
    else
    {
        return 'stay';
    }
});```

>The first parameter is the name of the expression the user must type in order to use this function helper.

>The second parameter is the function that will execute when the user uses this function helper.

Our function helper has 1 parameter and that’s the status of our user. Depending on the status, we’ll return different messages. By doing this, we can have custom conditional logic in our templates.

```js
var menuData = {
    name: "jack",
    status: "leaving",
};

<script id="menu-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
    Welcome {{name}}, <a href="#">Click here to {{checkStatus status}}</a>
</script>
```
To use our function helper, we just type in the name in our expression. To pass in the parameters, you just type them in after our function helper. If we had multiple parameters, you would just separate them with spaces.
